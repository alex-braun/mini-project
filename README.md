# Mini Project

The purpose of this project is to refactor an old project using `Router5` or to
use `PHP` and `laravel` to create a new project.

Take your time and have fun, look at your old code and see how far you have come
and make it better or learn a new and useful langauge/framework.

## Prerequisites

-   [PHP](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/php).
-   [Php-laravel](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/php-laravel).

## Requirements

Describe behavioral requirements as you'll be using them in tests. That is,
list requirements in language that describes how the written code will be used,
not how it will be written, with the exception of constraints you may wish to
place on implementation. It's a good idea to include the below paragraph
verbatim.

You should be running `grunt nag` before diagnosing any bugs, since it finds
some of the most common sources of errors. After `grunt nag` passes, you should
run `grunt test` to run the included tests. Tests will tell you whether of not
you've met these requirements.

## Bonus

Bonuses are described after the requirements, if included. They should be worked
on **only after** passing requirements.

Sometimes, we ask questions that promote thinking critically about code.
