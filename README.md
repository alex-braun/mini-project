# Mini Project

The purpose of this project is to refactor an old project using `Router5` or to
use `PHP` and `laravel` to create a new project.

Take your time and have fun, look at your old code and see how far you have come
and make it better or learn a new and useful langauge/framework.

## Prerequisites

-   [PHP](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/php).
-   [Php-laravel](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/php-laravel).

## Requirements

_If you choose to make a new project with `PHP` and `laravel`:_

-   Create and API that sends and recives C.R.U.D. reuquests.

-   Create a client that consumes and send JSON.

-   Your client should have all C.R.U.D. actions (if applicable).

-   Consider using `Router5`.

_If you choose to refactor a project:_

-   Refactor to incorporate `Router5` to change view states. (This is more
    difficult then it seems).
